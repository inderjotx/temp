        '<p><br /></p>\n' +
        '<p>Hotjar wants to make the web a better place. We believe many digital experiences - whether they are on desktop or mobile - quite frankly suck, and we are working to change that. </p>\n' +
        '<p><br /></p>\n' +
        '<p>We’re building easy and intuitive behaviour analytics software for businesses selling online.
